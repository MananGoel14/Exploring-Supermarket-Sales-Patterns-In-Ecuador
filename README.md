# Exploring-Supermarket-Sales-Patterns-In-Ecuador

Introduction and Motivation - This project aims to identify the key drivers of supermarket sales in Ecuador and provide actionable insights through an interactive Tableau dashboard. The dashboard integrates data from sales transactions, store information, promotions, oil prices, and holiday events to offer users an intuitive view of sales patterns across stores and product categories. The motivation for this project stems from the need to enhance decision-making for supermarket stakeholders by uncovering sales trends and external influences such as promotions, seasonality, and economic factors like oil prices. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for optimizing inventory management, refining promotional strategies, and catering to diverse consumer preferences. The business significance of this project lies in its potential to enable supermarkets to strategically align resources, mitigate risks from fluctuating market conditions, and enhance profitability by responding proactively to consumer demand and external trends. By leveraging a data-driven approach, this project empowers stakeholders to adapt to market changes, improve operational efficiency, and maximize profitability.
